### Lesson 1. What is Cryptography?

- What is cryptography?
    - The art and science of secret communication.
    - Cast of characters:
        - Good guys: Alice and Bob
        - Bad guys: Eve and Malory
    - basic terms: plaintext, ciphertext, encrypt, decrypt.

- What are the goals of cryptography?
    - Threat model: Read, Change, Forge.
    - Information security goals:
        - confidentiality - can't read our messages
        - integrity - can't change our messages
        - authenticity - can't forge our messages
    - Message key is the minimum amount of information Bob needs to decrypt Alice's message which is key secret from Eve.
    - Steganography: is the practice of hiding a secret message in something that is not secret.

### Lesson 2. Codes and Ciphers

- Codes vs Ciphers
    - Code involves replaces concepts with symbols. It is the meaning behind the message and not the form of the message that is encoded.
    - Cipher is when basic elements of an arbitrary message such as characters of text, or bits and bytes of digital data are enciphered without regard to what they mean within the message. Early ciphers fell into two categories, the transposition cipher and the substitution cipher.

- Transposition ciphers
    - Transposition ciphers is a cipher in which the letters that make up the plain text message are only rearranged.
    - First known example: scytale - the cipher text is generated by splitting the plain text into N strings, where N is the number of characters that can be written around the circumference of the Scytale. The N strings are then interleaved. The plaintext is recovered by taking every nth letter of the ciphertext to form the first group and then doing this N times, each time beginning with the next letter from the start and then reading the result starting with the first group.

- __Problem Idea__: Can you create a 3D scytale using randomly generated configs, use it as a message key between two parties. If I then encode a message, how long would it take to break that message?

- Substitution ciphers
    - Substitution cipher is a cipher where each character in the plain text while retaining its corresponding position within the cipher text is substituted by different character.
    - Example: Caesar, Mary Queen of Scots, Vigenere
    - An example of a powerful substitution cipher is when you randomly assign a character a value from the alphabet, there are 26 characters in the alphabet, so a computer would have to search for 26!, which is about 4 x 10^26 possible mappings. So, we don't have to keep the algorithm secret, we have to keep the mappings secret.
    - But certain letters are used more frequently in a given language than others. Thus it is possible to make good guesses about the mappings between plain text characters and cipher text characters based on how frequently different cipher text letters appear. Using frequency analysis, you can decipher the message.

- __Problem Idea__: When trying to break caesar cipher, can you add like a next word prediction to speed things up?

- Monoalphabet vs Polyalphabetic
    - Monoalphabetic: means that each character in a plain text was converted to a character in a cipher text using the same substitution rule. The Caesar ciphers were very simple monoalphabetic cipher that had very few options for the possible substitution rules.
    - Polyalphabetic: is any cipher based on substitution, using multiple substitution alphabets.
    - Vigenere cipher is a Polyalphabetic cipher. It uses all possible Caesar shift ciphers and lets each letter in a key phrase, determine which of the possible ciphers to use for a given character in the plain text or the cipher text.

# My Notes

- __Breaking the Vigenere cipher__: The method relied on the analysis of gaps between repeated fragments in the ciphertext; such analysis can give hints as to the length of the key used. This technique is known as Kasiski examination.

- In cryptography, __coincidence counting__ is the technique (invented by William F. Friedman) of putting two texts side-by-side and counting the number of times that identical letters appear in the same position in both texts. This count, either as a ratio of the total or normalized by dividing by the expected count for a random source model, is known as the index of coincidence, or IC for short. Because letters in a natural language are not distributed evenly, the IC is higher for such texts than it would be for uniformly random text strings. What makes the IC especially useful is the fact that its value does not change if both texts are scrambled by the same single-alphabet substitution cipher, allowing a cryptanalyst to quickly detect that form of encryption.
